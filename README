A GNU Guile script for generating open-scad molecule
models from .xyz files.
The script will print the open-scad source file to std-out.

Usage: guile xyz2openscad <input-file> > <output-file>
or     ./xyz2openscad <input-file> > <output-file>

This scripts supports piping the xyz file into it, which
makes it easy to use with open-babel.

The following example assumes you have a file called
"molecule.smi" which contains a smiles string for a molecule.

    obabel molecule.smi -o xyz --gen3d | guile xyz2openscad.scm > molecule.scad
or
    obabel molecule.smi -o xyz --gen3d | ./xyz2openscad.scm > molecule.scad

converts the smiles string to an xyz-file via open-babel, pipes the
result into the GNU Guile script, which generates an open-scad script
and saves it as "molecule.scad".
